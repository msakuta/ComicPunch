A simple HTML5 figure editor and viewer


## Objectives

Create a simple figure format that can replace Microsoft Word figures in
web documents.

It aims to have following features:

* Easily editable in-place by GUI.
* Easily embeddable into Wiki pages, blogs and design documents.
* Can be easily copy & pasted to another document.
* Unlike SVG, no complex graphics features are supported
* Has a text format that is easily examined and edited by human.
* Can also be saved as a separate text file.
* Can be easily compared with text-wise diff.
* Has extensible format.


## Current implementation

Current implementation uses YAML as format.
It enables easy inspection and editing by humans.

It can be edited by a static HTML document with JavaScript.
It's so easy to setup a server that accepts and shows uploaded figures.
